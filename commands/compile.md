description: Extract rules from CLAUDE.md and its referenced documents and compile them into trigger-bound rule files

# /nunchi:compile

Compile rules with the following procedure.

## 1. Collect input
- Argument: $ARGUMENTS
- If an argument is given, read only that document; otherwise read the project CLAUDE.md and every `@path` document it references.

## 2. Extract rules
From each document, extract only rules that "are effective when recalled right before a specific action." Criteria:
- Can it be tied to a specific tool call? (creating a PR, committing, editing a specific file, running a specific command)
- General guidance that can't be tied to an action (tone, coding style at large) is **not a compilation target** — skip it and report it at the end as a list of "uncompilable rules."

## 3. Infer triggers
For each rule, set a `tool` (Bash|Edit|Write) and a `pattern` (Python regex). Examples:
- PR rules → tool: Bash, pattern: `gh\s+pr\s+create`
- Commit conventions → tool: Bash, pattern: `git(\s+-\S+(\s+\S+)?)*\s+commit`
- Migration file rules → tool: Edit, pattern: `migrations/`
- Content rules ("no console.log") → tool: Edit, pattern: `console\.log`, field: `new_string`, path: `\.(ts|tsx)$`
A Bash rule's pattern matches against the command string; an Edit/Write rule's pattern matches against the file path. Add `field: <tool_input key>` under `trigger` to match against a specific input field instead (e.g. `new_string` for edit content, `content` for Write). Two hard-won cautions:
- **Content rules must carry a `path:` regex** (ANDed with `pattern` against the file path) scoping them to code files — otherwise the rule fires on example code inside markdown, comments, and even its own source document.
- **Git command patterns must allow global options** — `git\s+commit` misses `git -C <dir> commit`; use the `git(\s+-\S+(\s+\S+)?)*\s+<subcommand>` shape.

## 4. Decide strength
- The default is `require-read` (block once per session with the rule as the reason, let the retry through — guarantees a read at the cost of one retry).
- Only actions a document explicitly marks as "absolutely forbidden" get `block`.
- Use `inject` for advisory rules where even one blocked attempt is overkill (style reminders, soft conventions): the rule is delivered alongside the tool call with zero friction, but compliance is left to the model's judgment rather than forced by a retry.

## 5. Generate rule files
For each rule, create `.claude/rules/<kebab-case-name>.md`. If there is an original document, put its project-relative path in `source` and write only a **one-line summary** in the body. Two reasons, both hard requirements: the original is read at delivery time (so a pasted copy would drift), and Claude Code's native `.claude/rules/` loader injects the body at session start (so a long body would enter context twice — the body is the always-on declaration, the source is the JIT payload):

**Recompiling over existing rules**: a rule file that already matches its source document is kept — but "matches the document" is not enough. Also check every kept rule against the current trigger guidance (content rules must carry `path:`; git patterns must allow global options). If a kept rule violates it, don't keep it silently: include it in the review table with a proposed upgraded trigger, marked as an upgrade.

Filename convention: base the filename on the source document's filename in kebab-case (e.g. `docs/pr-rules.md` → `pr-rules.md`). If a single document yields multiple rules, append a content-based suffix to disambiguate (e.g. `pr-rules-title.md`, `pr-rules-reviewer.md`). If the resulting filename collides with an existing rule file, confirm with the user before overwriting it.

```markdown
---
name: pr-rules
trigger:
  tool: Bash
  pattern: gh\s+pr\s+create
source: docs/pr-rules.md
strength: require-read
enabled: true
---
PR creation rules — title format, required sections, reviewer assignment.
```

## 5.5 Propose dropping covered `@references`

If every rule extracted from an `@referenced` document was compiled (nothing from it landed in the uncompilable list), tell the user the `@path` line in CLAUDE.md can be removed: the document will then load just-in-time via the rule's `source` instead of at every session start (measured: `pilot/PROBE-context-economics.md`). If the document also produced uncompilable always-on guidance, do NOT propose removing it — say which part still needs the `@reference`.

## 6. User review
Show the list of generated rule files as a table (name / trigger / strength / source), and along with the list of uncompilable rules, ask "is there anything to fix?" An overly broad regex becomes a false positive, so scoping it conservatively narrow is the default.

If the user requests a change, edit only the affected rule file(s) and show the table again for another round of review. If the user requests no changes, treat the compilation as complete.

## 7. Closing lines
If at least one generated rule has a `source` document, show a one-line before/after right after the review is settled — byte-based, with tokens only as a rough estimate (tokenizers differ):

> always-on 컨텍스트: <sum of source doc bytes> → <sum of one-line rule bodies> (−N%), 상세 문서는 트리거 시에만 배달 — §5.5에서 @참조를 제거한 경우 기준.

Only if at least one rule file was generated, end the final message with this single line (once — never repeat it later in the session):
